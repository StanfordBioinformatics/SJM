Overview
========

The purpose of sjm is to manage groups of related jobs running on a
compute cluster.  The input to the program is a file containing a
description of the jobs that need to be run, the resources they
require and the dependencies between them.  sjm can do the following:

+ sjm dispatches each job to the batch queuing system once all of its
  dependencies have been satisfied
+ sjm monitors the progress of all running jobs and produces both a
  detailed log and a concise summary indicating any jobs that failed
+ sjm makes it easy to rerun any jobs that failed and the jobs that
  depend on them, without rerunning jobs that finished successfully
+ sjm can run jobs directly on the submission host as well as through
  the batch queuing system; this is useful if some tasks require
  resources only available on the head node of a cluster, such as
  network access to remote hosts
+ sjm can submit jobs using Platform LSF or Sun Grid Engine

Job Description File
====================

1. Example

The input to sjm is a job description file.  Here is a simple example:

# example sjm input file
job_begin
  name jobA
  time 4h
  memory 3G
  queue standard
  project sequencing
  cmd /home/lacroute/project/jobA.sh
job_end
job_begin
  name jobB
  time 2d
  memory 1G
  queue extended
  cmd_begin
    /home/lacroute/project/jobB_prolog.sh;
    /home/lacroute/project/jobB.sh;
    /home/lacroute/project/jobB_epilog.sh
  cmd_end
job_end
order jobA before jobB
log_dir /home/lacroute/project/log

This description defines two jobs names jobA and jobB.  Each job has
an optional time limit, an optional memory requirement, an optional
submission queue, and a command to run.  The "order" statement
specifies that jobA must finish before jobB can start.  Finally, the
"log_dir" statement specifies a directory where the output of each
command will be written.

2. Job Specification Blocks

A job specification block has the form:

job_begin
  STATEMENT1
  STATEMENT2
  ...
job_end

Each statement must be on a single line.  The following statements are
allowed within the job specification block:

name STRING
  [REQUIRED]
  The name of the job.  This name will be used in the log files and
  the batch queuing system.  Each job must have a unique name.

slots NUMBER
  [OPTIONAL]
  The number of processor slots (i.e. CPU cores) the job will use.

parallel_env NAME
  [OPTIONAL]
  The name of the parallel environment that defines the slot-allocation
  policy.

memory AMOUNT
  [OPTIONAL]
  The maximum amount of memory the job will use.  The job may be
  killed if it exceeds this amount.  The AMOUNT consists of a number
  followed by "b" (bytes), "k" (kilobytes), "m" (megabytes)
  or "g" (gigabytes).  Capital letters are allowed and spaces are ok.
  For example:
     memory 2G  (2 gigabytes)
     memory 1500 m (1500 megabytes)

time AMOUNT
  [OPTIONAL]
  The maximum amount of wallclock time the job will use.  The job may
  be killed if it exceeds this amount.  The AMOUNT consists of a
  number followed by "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours)
  or "d" (days).  Capital letters are allowed and spaces are ok.
  For example:
    time 2d   (2 days)
    time 4 H  (4 hours)

queue STRING
  [OPTIONAL]
  The name of the queue for job submission.

project STRING
  [OPTIONAL]
  The name of the project the job is associated with.  Generally
  the name must be a project that has been registered with the job
  submission system.

cmd STRING
  [REQUIRED]
  The command to run.  The command must be specified on a single
  line.  The command line will be interpreted by the shell so it
  can contain file redirection characters, etc.  For multi-line
  commands there is an alternate form (see the next statement type).

cmd_begin
  CMD_LINE1
  CMD_LINE2
  ...
cmd_end
  [REQUIRED]
  The command to run.  Use this form instead of "cmd" for multi-line
  commands.  The command will be interpreted by the shell.  Newlines
  are treated as spaces, so you can spread a single command over
  multiple lines.  If there are multiple commands then separate
  them with semicolons.

export NAME
export NAME=VALUE
  [OPTIONAL]
  An environment variable to pass to the command.  The first form
  copies the current value of the specified environment variable.  The
  second form sets the value explicitly.

module NAME
  [OPTIONAL]
  An environment module that will be loaded when running the command.

directory PATHNAME
  [OPTIONAL]
  A directory (specified as a full path) that will be used as the
  current working directory when running the command.

host localhost
  [OPTIONAL]
  Run this job on the local host instead of submitting it to the batch
  system.

sched_options STRING ...
  [OPTIONAL]
  Specify additional scheduler-specific options.  For Sun Grid Engine
  you may include qsub options that are not available through the
  other directives.

3. Other Statements

Outside of a job specification block (not within the job_begin/job_end
keywords) the following statements are allowed:

order JOB1 before JOB2
  [OPTIONAL]
  JOB1 and JOB2 are job names.  JOB1 must finish before JOB2 can start.

order JOB2 after JOB1
  [OPTIONAL]
  JOB1 and JOB2 are job names.  JOB1 must finish before JOB2 can start.

log_dir STRING
  [OPTIONAL]
  Specifies a directory where all of the output from each job will be
  stored.  Standard output will go into a file named JOBNAME_oTIME.txt
  and standard error will go into a file named JOBNAME_eTIME.txt where
  JOBNAME is the name of the job and TIME is the time when sjm started
  running.  Both of these files will be in the directory specified by
  this statement.  Note that this statement only applies to jobs
  submitted through the batch system and not to jobs run on the local
  host (use command-line I/O redirection in the job description for local
  host jobs).

The job specification file may also contain comment lines beginning
with a "#".

Running sjm
===========

Run sjm as follows:

sjm [options] JOB_FILE

JOB_FILE is the job description file.  For a description of all the
options, run "sjm --help".  Most of them allow you to adjust
parameters but usually the defaults are fine.  The most useful options
are:

-i  run sjm in the foreground and print log messages to the terminal;
    the default is to run in the background and store log messages in
    a file names JOB_FILE.status.log

-r  instead of dispatching the jobs, output a graphical representation
    of the job dependency graph in "dot" format.  See www.graphviz.org
    for programs to display this format.

sjm produces three output files:

1) The log file (JOB_FILE.status.log by default, or standard output with
   -i option) contains a running log of all the jobs sjm submits and
   has a summary at the end indicating which jobs completed
   successfully.
2) The status file (JOB_FILE.status by default) contains detailed
   information about the status of each job.  It can be used to rerun
   sjm if some of the jobs fail.
3) The backup status file (JOB_FILE.status.bak by default) is a
   slightly-older backup copy of the status file.  Use this file if
   sjm crashes while updating the status file and leaves it in a
   corrupted state (hopefully very rare!)

If the log file indicates that some jobs failed, once you have
determined the cause and fixed anything that needs to be modified you
can rerun the failed jobs by running sjm on the status file or the
backup status file:

cp JOB_FILE.status JOB_FILE2
sjm JOB_FILE2

The job summary in the log file consists of lines that look like:

job0 (5714): 1:23:06 (513 sec, 120/167 MB)

The fields are:
  job name (job0)
  batch system job ID (5714)
  wallclock time (1 hour, 23 minutes, 6 seconds)
  CPU time (513 sec)
  maximum virtual memory usage (120 MB)
  maximum swap usage (167 MB)

While sjm is running you can kill all the currently-running jobs by
sending an interrupt to the sjm process.  If it was run with the -i
(interactive) flag, just hit CTRL-C.  Otherwise, find the process id
(e.g. "ps | fgrep sjm") and then run "kill -INT process_id".
